<!-- ## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website. -->

Next JS Tensorwave take home. 

We start with the nextjs dashboard example to quickly get an viable product out.

As well, for the charts I used chartjs because it's just so easy.

In the interest of time and efficiency, I decided to use a database for the historical prices and only update prices on page loads. 

In a production environment, you would want cached requests using something like redis. As well, you would have a realtime functionality using something like sockets.
